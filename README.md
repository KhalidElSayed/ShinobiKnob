ShinobiKnob
===========

A simple knob control, used as a demonstration for "The Art of Custom UI Controls" - the presentation I gave at 360iDev.

Please fork it if you find it useful, or raise any issues that you have. I should spend some more time on it to improve it - if people ask for it then I shall :)


## Requirements

Requires iOS7 and Xcode5.
